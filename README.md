## Introduction
### Program Status

Much of the program works, but with very little functionality.   
Feel free to look at the code directly.

### What this program does
This program imports the 
["Java Photo Library" repository](https://github.com/AdamFariello/Java-Photo-Viewer)

This repository is the work from, and for, the cs213 assignment: *"Android Application"*.
[The course](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/course-synopses/course-details/01-198-213-software-methodology) was taken during Spring 2021
